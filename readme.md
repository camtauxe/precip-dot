These data constitute an effort to update the NOAA Atlas 14 for Alaska using more recent historical observed climate information and adding in the effects of a changing climate. The goal is to produce a similar set of data as is displayed and served currently through the [NOAA Atlas 14 Precipitation Frequency Web Interface](https://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/pfds_map_ak.html), using the WRF Dynamically Downscaled Data for Alaska produced by researchers affiliated with the Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center (AK-CASC). This work is funded by the Alaska Department of Transportation (AKDOT) to add climate futures data to existing workflows designing culverts and other engineering features of road construction.
