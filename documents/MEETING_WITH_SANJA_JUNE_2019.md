each station has its own region
build regions based on similar stations
	- mean annual max series
	weight l-moments on sample size
	mean annual precip
	interp on regular grid

cascade through the return periods

make a finer grid from the 1km data using 


IDEA:
- 1km MAM values mean annual maximum
	-> ratio between the 1km and the 400x400km grid 

	ratio is performed with the similar time-frame to downscale the data to 1km from the 20km 
	then we would perform the delta method to show diffs from that new ratio-based baseline period.

CLIMATE -- 
- stationarity is the assumption.  

calc l-moments 

sample size is HUGELY important

They are moving to the MaxLike approiach from the l-moments

use the PDS approach that is laid out in the paper
